| 3 - Shiny Web App | Complete |


### <font color = "red">Objective:</font> 

- We are not competing with other teams on kaggle
- This project is a playground to practice the knowledge of this class and prepare for the final exam.
- Group project, 1-3 people per team. You can be your own team. 
- You can use `R` or Python
- Build one prediction model using the ML algorithms of this course
- Evaluate your prediction model
- Try different ways to improve your model and show the improvements.
- Submit code and results in Jupyter and `HTML` formats on canvas
